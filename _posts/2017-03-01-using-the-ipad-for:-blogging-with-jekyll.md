[Matt Gemmell on blogging with Jekyll on the iPad](http://mattgemmell.com/using-the-ipad-for-blogging-with-jekyll/):

> Since it talks to Dropbox, I can just create new articles directly in my Dropbox where I keep my entire Jekyll site, and theyâ€™re ready to go when I next build and publish (more about that later).

> So now I can blog from anywhere at all, using just the iPad, with a bare minimum of hassle

I would add that it is possible from the iPhone. I'd like to be able to post here from any of my devices with a minimum of fuss. I'm also using Github pages for the back end, so there is no need for any server access or command line to regenerate the html. He also mentions using Flickr to host the images. I might give that a shot.
